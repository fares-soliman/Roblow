## About
A fully autonomous snowblower that I made using an electric snowblower, an Arduino, some ultrasonic sensors, and my trusty plywood sheet :)

### Some things to note
- Arm that moves to direct snow still to be implemented
- Proper waterproofing needs to be implemented (no more garbage bags)
- Uses the Sabertooth and the NewPing libraries. Must be installed to use the code
